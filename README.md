# Project Rental Housing Management System

The project aims to develop a rental management system to help landlords manage tenant information, rooms, contracts, and support tickets. The system includes key functions such as managing rooms/properties, tenant information, invoices, contract details, support tickets, updating information, calculating bills, revenue statistics, information search, access control, and backup.

The main stages of the project include:

1. Project Initiation: Forming the team, establishing team contracts, and project declaration.

2. Project Planning: Selecting the software development model, project organization structure, and scheduling.

3. System Development: Designing and developing the system, including database design and coding.
