# Project Rental Housing Management System

The project aims to develop a rental management system to help landlords manage tenant information, rooms, contracts, and support tickets. The system includes key functions such as managing rooms/properties, tenant information, invoices, contract details, support tickets, updating information, calculating bills, revenue statistics, information search, access control, and backup.

## Project Management Course

The team is using the Waterfall model to manage the project. This is a linear software development model where phases are executed sequentially. The model is chosen for its clarity and simplicity, which aids in better management of project stages.

The main stages of the project include:

1. Project Initiation: Forming the team, establishing team contracts, and project declaration.

2. Project Planning: Selecting the software development model, project organization structure, and scheduling.

3. System Development: Designing and developing the system, including database design and coding.

4. Testing: Functional, integration, and system-wide testing to ensure quality.

## Information system Analysis and Design Course

The main stages:

**1. Current Situation Survey:** Conduct interviews and surveys to gather information about the current process of renting houses, managing contracts, invoices, customers, and technical support.

**2. Software Requirements Definition:**

  - Functional Requirements: Store information about customers, rooms, support tickets, invoices, contracts, and accounts. Search for information about customers, support tickets, rooms, and contracts. Calculate and generate statistics on invoices, revenue, and room status.

  - Non-Functional Requirements: User-friendly interface, user role-based access control, system security.

**3. System Design:**

  - Design use-case diagrams to describe the actors and use cases of the system.

  - Design activity diagrams to describe the main business processes.
  
  - Design class diagrams and state diagrams to describe the structure and behavior of the system objects.
  
  - Develop entity-relationship models and relational models to manage data.

**4. Implementation and Testing:**
  
  - Set up the development and deployment environment.
  
  - Design user interfaces for landlords and tenants.
  
  - Perform testing to ensure the system functions correctly.
